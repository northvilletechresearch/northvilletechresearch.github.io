      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sometime in the near future, we will wake up to a world where hundreds, maybe thousands, of drones will be whizzing through the air.</b> These small aerial objects will be an integral part to society, gathering data about health, safety, and incoming dangers. The popularity of this technology is growing, if not already at its prime height, and while its market is not in the foreground, it will become extremely prevalent in the future, as companies such as Amazon try to implement this technology to allow their products to reach their destination sooner. We at the Technology Review and Research Club have provided you with a comprehensive guide to the drone, giving you everything you would need to step into this market and thrive in it.</p>
      <p> Drones, more commonly known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems, are extremely prevalent in the military. A drone can provide a country’s military a “twenty-four hour eye in the sky” and send back video and audio data in real-time. With regards to the United States, drones were most recently used to probe the tribal regions of Pakistan, where Pakistani militants were said to have been. With this technology, the United States Air Force was able to survey and limit the militants’ movement. 
      As far as military drone models go, the key drones in play are the MQ-1B Predator and the MQ-9 Reaper. The MQ-9 Reaper features a “Multi-Spectral Targeting System” which is a suite of visual sensors for targeting a specific item or person on the ground with high accuracy. These sensors include but are not limited to: a infrared sensor, color/monochrome TV camera, image-intensified TV camera and a laser rangefinder, designator and illuminator. Similarly, the MQ-1B Predator also carries this “Multi-Spectral Targeting System”, but also has a turbocharged engine, which is a turbine engine that increases efficiency in the turbine to reach faster speeds. All of these technologies contribute to a system that can act with ninety-nine percent accuracy and robustly carry out instructions.  
      In sum, the idea of a drone participating regularly in military campaigns has become a norm amongst highly industrialized countries and many of these countries are putting vast amounts of money into the improvement and construction of drones for the war front as well as to protect civilians on the homefront. 
      </p>
      <p>The industry is definitely not a stagnant one. DJI, one of the largest drone companies in the consumer market valued at around 10 billion dollars, and a  quick search on Amazon will lead you to find thousands of different quadcopters, ranging from thousand dollar UAVs equipped with 4k cameras to four dollar toys that can sit on your palm. Amazon itself is investing in its own drone made to deliver items. And the trends in the private sector are mirrored in the military as well, with recent statistics by the bureau of journalistic investigation showing that drone strikes in Afghanistan alone went up from 1071 in 2016 to 2051 in 2017.
      But all is not looking up for this infant industry. A growing, and perhaps warranted, uneasiness has been spreading throughout the public, raising concerns on privacy and safety. With recent events such as a drone-airplane collision on the 16th of October, there has been a swell of regulations. Some are logical and harmless; for example, most states now prohibit drones from entering a few hundred feet within airports. But some may be potentially damaging to this budding industry. As of mid-2016, drones that repeatedly fly require a license, as per federal law. And while some may not have a problem with it, others may be deterred by these extra steps. And while this may not be trouble in the near future, if companies like Amazon want to continue with their ground-breaking experimentation, they may have trouble with the mounting regulations. These regulations may be the deterrent to a greater implementation of this new technology.
      On this subject, Kevin Moser, leader of the Northville Drone Club, explains that “it's a shame”. “Because of the actions of a few stupid people”, he declares as he carefully solder the wires on the racing drone he and his club members are building, “drones may have a tough time in the future”. He claims that “recent regulations are doing more bad than good, since they're not regulating the right things”. Despite these seemingly pessimistic observations, Kevin is rather optimistic for the future of drones: “I think there's going to be more application for drones since they're cheap”. Kevin can attest to that, spending less than 50 dollars on a drone that is toe-to-toe with thousand dollar drones spec wise.
      Drones are an exciting and new technology, and if they can overcome recent hurdles, they may turn out changing our lives like no other technology has.</p>
